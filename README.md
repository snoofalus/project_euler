A collection of my program code solutions for Project Euler. Project Euler is described as "A series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve". The original problems can be found at [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

From now on likely only gonna add a few thougher problems to the list.

## Assorted solutions 
Below are some solutions to problems I found particularly interesting.

### 5 Smallest multiple

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.  
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

### 9 Special Pythagorean triplet

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,
a2 + b2 = c2

For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.
